# My Diary!

This web application allows us to have a private place, disconnected from the cloud, to be able to freely express all the emotions we feel on a daily basis, either out of habit, or because of our mental health üß†, wherever we are, having our mobile phone.

## Why?

It started because I heard about IndexedDB from browsers and wanted to try it out, at first it was input text and the inputs under it, and slowly it took shape, and I put the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa cookbook aside üòÖ

## It's not live, how do I use it?

Being a purely frontend application, it does not have much complication
